This is a very simple project meant to important and process data from the "Star Wars API" (a 'practice' API filled with data about the various peoples and places from the star wars universe, URL: https://swapi.dev/)
There are several design decisions that were made in the interest of keeping the project small and within the scope of 'API Querying' such as the use of const magic numbers that would have to be made more dynamic for a larger scale app.

Additionally, there is a sort of 'backup' class that exists in the event of the Star Wars API ever going down or becoming closed to the general public. this class has some hard coded data in it that is meant to mirror data that one might pull from the real API

Concepts Explored in this project
